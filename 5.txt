AIM: Practical of Time-series forecasting.

Theory:
Making predictions about the future is called extrapolation in the classical statistical handling of time series data.
More modern fields focus on the topic and refer to it as time series forecasting.
Forecasting involves taking models fit on historical data and using them to predict future observations.
Descriptive models can borrow for the future (i.e. to smooth or remove noise), they only seek to best describe the data.
An important distinction in forecasting is that the future is completely unavailable and must only be estimated from what has already happened. The skill of a time series forecasting model is determined by its performance at predicting the future. This is often at the expense of being able to explain why a specific prediction was made, confidence intervals and even better understanding the underlying causes behind the problem.
Exploration of Time Series Data in R:
Here we’ll learn to handle time series data on R. Our scope will be restricted to data exploring in a time series type of data set and not go to building time series models.
I have used an inbuilt data set of R called AirPassengers. The dataset consists of monthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949 to 1960.
Loading the Data Set
Following is the code which will help you load the data set and spill out a few top level metrics.

> data(AirPassengers)
> class(AirPassengers)
> start(AirPassengers)
> end(AirPassengers)
> frequency(AirPassengers)
> summary(AirPassengers)
> plot(AirPassengers)
> abline(reg=lm(AirPassengers~time(AirPassengers)))
> cycle(AirPassengers)
> plot(aggregate(AirPassengers,FUN=mean))

Auto – correlation Function(ACF): ACF is a plot of total correlation between different lag functions.
Following are the ACF plots for the series :

> acf(log(AirPassengers))
> acf(diff(log(AirPassengers)))
> (fit <- arima(log(AirPassengers), c(0, 1, 1),seasonal = list(order = c(0, 1, 1), period = 12)))
> pred <- predict(fit, n.ahead = 10*12)
> ts.plot(AirPassengers,2.718^pred$pred, log = "y", lty = c(1,3))
